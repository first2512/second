                            <p>On June 29, 2024, at first, I met you on the WhatsApp group. Honestly, that was the first time. <br>
 I tried to join the group. It was just for fun because I had nothing to do at that time. <br>
Not long after, you also joined the group. <br>
I still remember you introducing yourself and sending a photo. <br>
 You wore a black dress and a hat. Really cute and caught my attention. Although you're younger than me, it's not an obstacle for me to get to know you first. I was the first who reached you out.  <br>
My first impression of you when we were chatting was that you were really funny and engaged in conversation. You also told me that you were on vacation in Bali, wow! (it's really cool, I said to myself). Long story short, after work, I chatted with you again, and it was true that you were really cute, I like all your stories. <br>
Honestly, your story can make my tiredness after work disappear for a while. Time passed so fast. I didn't even realize that we had been chatting until midnight. You are a kind and cheerful girl, although we just chatted for a day. After we chatted almost everyday for a whole week, you often sent me photos when you were on vacation in Bali. I felt that I was a very special person at that time. I think the happiest moment in my life was when I got to know you.
