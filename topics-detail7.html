                            <p>This is the second time I have written a letter to you. Yet, honestly, I never wrote a letter to a woman before. <br>
Yes, you are the first woman who has made me crazy like this. I can't believe it's already February. People say that it's the month of love. <br>
Hmm, coincidentally, my birthday also falls in this month, which people say is a month of love. I don't know. 
All I know is that I wanna convey my feelings for you on this day of love and this special month. 
Thank you for being my source of happiness. Maybe this is a way from God for my last worst heartbreak. 
Honestly, that was the hardest time in my life, but then you came at the right time and could heal wounds in my heart. 
At first, I felt comfortable with you. You are cheerful and always cheer me up. And now, as time goes by, I think I start to like you. 
There is something special about you that makes me always attracted to you. Thank you for sharing many stories with me, sharing laughter, and sharing concern for each other. 
I apologize for still loving you. I have tried to forget you, yet I can't. Even in my busy days, I'm still thinking of you. <br>
I think I'm already crazy because I think of you every day. Today, I even had a patient with a name similar to yours. I remember you. My patient is still 15 years old. <br> 
She had a fever. It made me wonder if you were okay there? I always hope that you are okay there. I saw high school kids coming home from school, and I remember you (it's really exciting, right?). I ate tiramisu cake, and I remember you (ooh, so this is your favorite food). 
I saw a blue sky, I remember you. Reading the word Bogor, I remember you. I saw the Pocoyo sticker, I remember you. Every going to sleep, I remember you. And many more. 
You even appear in my dreams, making me happy but sad on the other side because I know it's only a dream. It's okay. At least it made me smile for a moment before I woke up. <br>
I know it's hard. I'm still here, loving you secretly from a distance. It's like a human who loves the moon because of the distance between us.
